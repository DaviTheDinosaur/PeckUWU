<h1>What is Progress Bar?</h1>

<p>Progress Bar is a progress and task management system for FRC Team 1540. Created by Elo, Application Software Manger, Progress Bar aims to:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Create 'progress bars' for every department per robot</li>
		<li>incluing checkpoints along it so people knowo what their goals are, and deadlines so people know how much time they have</li>
		<li>Allow managers to sign in in order to add checkpoint</li>
		<li>Allow multi and cross-department taskflow lines, so everyone knows when robots get handed over to other departments</li>
		<li>Display the website on a screen in Houston, The Lego Lab, and/or The Fab Lab, for everyone to see all the time(kind of like CLUCK but cooler)</li>
	</ul>
